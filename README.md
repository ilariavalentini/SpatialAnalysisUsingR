## Spatial Analysis Using R  

This repository hosts scripts and information for the 'Spatial Analysis Using R' workshop at US-IALE 2018.  

### Instructions

In this repository, you will find three scripts and data for the workshop.  

1. Please bring your own device, preferably with (R/RStudio)[https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/] installed.  
2. I have added sample data, which will be used during the workshop. Alternately, you are more than welcome to bring your own data and play around with it during the workshop.  

### Details

This workshop will cover the basics in spatial analysis within the R programming environment. Topics covered include basic spatial operations and storage of data, vector and raster manipulation, packages and functions that offer tools analogous to ones offered in QGIS/ArcGIS and basics of static mapping.  

Basic knowledge of R and ArcGIS/QGIS is required.

**Caveat** By no means is this workshop meant to cover all possible types of spatial analyses within R, but the hope is to provide a glimpse of analyses possible, that would often otherwise trouble you within a GUI environment. Further, this workshop is meant to cater to users with differing levels of experience in R and spatial analysis and is not meant to be for advanced users.
